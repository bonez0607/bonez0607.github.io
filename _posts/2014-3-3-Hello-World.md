#This is my first post

I am test this to to see if it works. 

I plan to use this to help document some of my learnings, a place to store my findings, and a document record to help me see my growth.  This will primarily be web based, but will also include other aspects of my life.

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
